This is a small Rust Pokédex for use in pbirch. It only includes data deemed
necessary for battle simulation. Even though it does have a web interface
([vdex_web][]), it is not meant to be used as a reference. The data is pulled
from [veekun][veekun-git] anyway, so just [use that][veekun-web] (though it is
"languishing," so maybe use [Serebii][] or [Bulbapedia][] or [Pokémon DB][]
instead).

This repository contains data extracted from the Pokémon series of games.
Please see the copyright discussion on the [main pbirch repository's
readme][pbirch-readme].
